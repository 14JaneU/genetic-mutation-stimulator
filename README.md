# Genetic Mutation Simulator

A Python-based tool for simulating genetic mutations in DNA sequences and analysing their potential biological impact.

## Project Overview
This project simulates common genetic mutation types (substitution, insertion, deletion) and explores how these mutations may affect protein translation. The aim is to bridge computational biology with real-world genomics applications.

## Features (Planned)
- DNA sequence validation
- Simulation of substitution, insertion, and deletion mutations
- Protein translation and comparison
- Mutation frequency analysis
- Data visualisation
- Optional interactive web interface

## Technologies
- Python
- Biopython
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit

## Status
In development (Day 1: DNA validation and project setup completed)
